## Getting to Production {style="font-size: 2em; color: blue;"}

<br>

You've written a kickass app! Now what?

## üí¨ Discussion

-   How are we presenting our code?

-   What is the data architecture?

-   Where is it being deployed?

-   Is it secure and accessible?

-   Does it scale?

## Think about data auth early!

## Choosing the right presentation layer

<br>

*Presentation Layer* üñºÔ∏è ‚Äì what the end users of the app directly interact with. It‚Äôs the displays, buttons, and functionality the user experiences.

<br>

*Processing Layer* ‚öíÔ∏è ‚Äì the processing that happens as a result of user interactions. Sometimes, it is called the *business logic*.

<br>

*Data Layer* üõ¢Ô∏è ‚Äì how and where the app stores and retrieves data.

## Presentation Layer

## What's happening with the data?

-   Can you remove the data processing and storage from the presentation?

-   Can you pre-calculate anything?

-   Can you reduce data granularity?

-   When is data pulled in and refreshed?

## Data Storage

| Location      | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| With the code | Data is updated as often or less often than the app code and doesn‚Äôt need to be shared across projects                                                                                                                                  |
| Database      | Gold standard for data storage and access                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Pins          | Lightweight datasets, ephemeral data, models                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Choosing a REST API

-   standardized format for communication regardless of programming language

-   standardized documentation - swagger

-   packages in R (httr2) and Python (requests) for connecting

-   Smaller pieces are easier to manage - an API can make your code more modular

::: notes
In the case of a general-purpose three-layer app, it is almost always the case that the middle tier will be an API. Separating processing logic into functions is often sufficient in a data science app. But, separating it into an API is often helpful if you‚Äôve got a long-running bit of business logic, like training an ML model.

APIs are the standard way for two computer systems to communicate. API is a general term that describes machine-to-machine communication. For our purposes, we‚Äôre talking about `http`-based `REST`-ful APIs.

`http` operates on a request-response model. So when you use an API, you send a request to the API and it sends a response back.

## How a REST API works

![](assets/images/03/req_resp.png)

:::

## HTTP requests and responses

| Verb   | Function                              |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| GET    | retrieve data                         |
| POST   | send some data and receive a response |
| PUT    | send data to update existing thing    |
| DELETE | delete something that exists          |

## Response Code

|     | Description                                      |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------|
| 2xx | Request is successful!                           |
| 4xx | Client error. You may have done something wrong! |
| 5xx | Server error.                                    |

## Anatomy of an API

-   **Host (fixed):**
    -   [`http://api.hostname.io/`]{style="background-color:#fff2cc"}
-   **Endpoint:**
    -   Resource location (think of as a function)
    -   `http://api.hostname.io/end-point`
-   **Parameters (optional):**
    -   key-value pairs specify what you want URL to return
    -   `http://api.hostname.io/end-point/?param=value`
-   **Headers & body (optional):**
    -   metadata attached to HTTP request to a server or response from server
    -   Examples include auth credentials, type of data returned

::: notes
You can think of an API as a ‚Äúfunction as a service‚Äù. That is, an API is just one or more functions,

application programming interface clients to communicate with a server. Rest API is a kind of web-service which stores and retrieves necessary data. It provides great flexibility to developers since it does not need any dependent code libraries to access the web-services. Amongst the many protocols supported by REST, the most common one is HTTP. When a request is sent from the client using a HTTPRequest, a corresponding response is sent from the server using HTTPResponse.

## Where to deploy our app?

![](assets/images/03/slides.png)

-   cloud container deployment + registry

-   build your own

-   platform as a service

-   Cloud platform all in one

## Things to consider when choosing a deployment framework

-   cost

-   how many apps to deploy? what kinds of apps?

-   who are users? do they need to login?

-   how secure does the data need to be? (and the server it resides in)

-   compute resources

-   integration with git and ci/cd

## Making Requests to your API

-   curl
-   R
-   Python
-   SDK?

## curl

``` bash

curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://granite-mole.fd049.fleeting.rstd.io/rsconnect/content/e444fd65-634f-4b6a-bc78-be70c790cc3f/predict' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Key ${CONNECT_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
  "species": "Adelie",
  "sex": "female",
  "bill_length_mm": 40.0
}'
```

## R

``` r
library(httr2)

url <- "https://granite-mole.fd049.fleeting.rstd.io/rsconnect/content/e444fd65-634f-4b6a-bc78-be70c790cc3f/predict"
headers <- c(
  "accept" = "application/json",
  "Content-Type" = "application/json",
  "Authorization" = paste("Key", Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"))
)
body <- list(
  species = "Adelie",
  sex = "female",
  bill_length_mm = 40.0
)

response <- request(url) %>%
  req_headers(headers) %>%
  req_body_json(body) %>%
  req_method("POST") %>%
  req_perform()

print(response)
```

## Python

``` python
import requests
import os

url = 'https://granite-mole.fd049.fleeting.rstd.io/rsconnect/content/e444fd65-634f-4b6a-bc78-be70c790cc3f/predict'
headers = {
    'accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': f'Key {os.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")}'
}
data = {
    "species": "Adelie",
    "sex": "female",
    "bill_length_mm": 40.0
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

print(response.json())
```

## üîç Deploy API in Docker

<br>

```         
# Use the official Python base image
FROM python:3.11.4-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the required dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entire project into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port FastAPI will run on
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the FastAPI app with Uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

<br> <br> - Build the image with `docker build -t fastapi-penguin-app .` <br> - Run the container with `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 fastapi-penguin-app`

## What are these weird port numbers?

-   We map the Docker Host Port to the Application Port!

<br> ![](assets/images/04/port%20mapping.png)

## üîç Example

```{bash}
docker pull httpd:alpine
docker pull httpd:latest

docker inspect --format='{{.Config.ExposedPorts}}' httpd:latest
docker inspect --format='{{.Config.ExposedPorts}}' httpd:alpine


docker run -d -p 80:80 --name httpd-latest httpd:latest
curl http://localhost:81

docker run -d -p 6574:80 --name httpd-alpine httpd:alpine
curl http://localhost:80

```

## üîç Deploy container with CI/CD

``` yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/fastapi-penguin-app:latest
